- [X] Sanity check tests
** DONE Join two models
- [X] Extract RHS function code.
- [X] Merge RHS function codes and form return line.
- [X] Sanity check tests with ~ECMMon~
** DONE Multi-site core model
- [X] Simple ~Reduce~ implementation with ~JoinModels~
- [X] Sanity check tests with ~ECMMon~
- [X] Check that works with 100s cell identifiers
  | n sites | creation time | simulation time |
  |---------+---------------+-----------------|
  |      20 | 0.2 s         | 28 s            |
  |      50 | 1.0 s         | 332 s           |
  |     100 | 3.5 s         |                 | 
- These creation and running statistics make the whole multi-site model less attractive.
  - In R. In WL the approach is working just fine.
